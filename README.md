Stream Example App
------------------

This example app shows you how you can use [GetStream.io](https://getstream.io/ "GetStream.io") to build a site similar to Pinterest.

The application is built using Laravel Framework; the best way to try this application is via Heroku; you can deploy this example (for free) on Heroku
by pressing the Deploy button below.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

If you prefer to run this locally then make sure to generate the API keys on [GetStream.io](https://getstream.io/ "GetStream.io") and update the settings in
app/config/database.php and in app/config/stream.php.

Once you have the right settings you can get your database ready by running the provision command (```./provision.sh```)
